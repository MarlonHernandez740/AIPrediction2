# Project Title AI Prediction

## Problem
The problem I am trying to solve is predicting a student’s store score based on different factors related to the student.
This matters because predicting student performance can help teachers and schools identify students who may need extra support and improve learning outcomes.

## Solution
This project uses a machine learning model to analyze student data and find patterns.
The model takes in student-related inputs (such as study habits, attendance, or past scores) and predicts a student’s store score as a number.
By training on past data, the model can make predictions for new students.

## Tools
Language: Thonny

Libraries:

pandas

scikit-learn

Dataset: student_data.csv

AI Model: Linear Regression

## Results - Output Screenshot
The model was able to generate numerical predictions for student store scores based on the input data.
The predicted values were close to the actual scores, showing the model learned meaningful relationships from the data.

## Learning
One important thing I learned from this project is how machine learning models use data to make predictions and how changing the input data can affect the model’s output.
